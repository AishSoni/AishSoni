## 🚀 About Me

**Curious. Consistent. Always building.**

I'm currently studying Electronics and Communication Engineering at **IIIT Bhopal**, but most of my growth has come from building in the real world—organizing hackathons, leading developer clubs, and shipping projects that people actually use.  

I thrive at the intersection of **software engineering and AI**, and I’m excited to keep building impactful products with great teams.
