## 🚀 About Me

**Curious. Consistent. Always building.** That's how I'd describe myself!

I'm currently studying Electronics and Communication Engineering at **IIIT Bhopal**, but most of my growth has happened outside classrooms—organizing national hackathons, leading developer clubs, and shipping projects that people actually use. I thrive at the intersection of **code, design, and leadership**, and I'm excited to keep building impactful software with great teams.

- 🎓 B.Tech ECE Student at IIIT Bhopal
- 💻 Full-Stack Developer with passion for AI/ML
- 🌱 Currently exploring Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) research
- 🎯 Looking for opportunities to grow as a developer, collaborator, and leader
- 📍 Based in India (Asia/Kolkata timezone)
- 💬 Ask me about React, Next.js, AI agents, or organizing tech events!
